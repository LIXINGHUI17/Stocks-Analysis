# Stocks-Analysis
[VBA_Challenge.xlsm](VBA_Challenge.xlsm)

# Overview of Project
## The purpose and background are well defined.
  ### In this Project, I use the VBA solution code to analyze the Stock Price. For Refactoring I just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

# Results
## The analysis is well described with screenshots and code.

### 1. The tickerIndex is set equal to zero before looping over the rows.
#### Create a tickerIndex variable and set it equal to zero before iterating over all the rows. You will use this tickerIndex to access the correct index across the four different arrays you’ll be using: the tickers array and the three output arrays you’ll create in Step 1b.

### 2. Arrays are created for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices.
### 3. The tickerIndex is used to access the stock ticker index for the tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices arrays.
### 4. The script loops through stock data, reading and storing all of the following values from each row: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices.
### 5. Code for formatting the cells in the spreadsheet is working.
### 6. There are comments to explain the purpose of the code.
### 7. The outputs for the 2017 and 2018 stock analyses in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm workbook match the outputs from the AllStockAnalysis in the module.
### 8. The pop-up messages showing the elapsed run time for the script are saved as VBA_Challenge_2017.png and VBA_Challenge_2018.png.
